Subject: Call for MASQUE use cases

~~~

The core MASQUE protocol [1] describes a simple negotiation mechanism for various 
applications. However, it omits use cases for these applications. MASQUE obfuscation
in support of a "hidden VPN" service is one use case [2]. Tunneling QUIC is another [3].

Given that MASQUE and the upcoming BoF will be successful insofar as it addresses important 
use cases, I think it'd be useful to discuss these application use cases in more detail 
before Vancouver. To that end, let's use this time before the meeting to discuss them! 

I'd like to ask interested parties to please surface use cases they know of (and care about). 

Thanks!
Chris
